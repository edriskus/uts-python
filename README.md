# Up to Speed with Python

*A collection of tutorials and exercises for learning the basics of Python*

## Getting started

- All lessons are described in .md files in `lessons` directory
- Every lesson has its own topic sections
- Almost every topic section has an external link to a tutorial with more learning material. These tutorials are *mandatory* to understand the given topic.
- Some of the topics have exercises  - they're here for you to test your skills from that topic
- At the end of the lesson there's 1 or more "Final exercise". By completing the exercises, you finish the lesson and can continue to the next one.
